## Hi there 👋

<!--
**wxwang-443/wxwang-443** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Hi, I'm Wei
- I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering
- I chose my major because I like to work on any related electrical device
- I want to learn more progaming technique from EE 205
